//! Azul is a free, functional, immediate-mode GUI framework for rapid development
//! of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender
//! rendering engine, using a flexbox-based CSS / DOM model for layout and styling.
//!
//! # Concept
//!
//! Azul is largely based on the principle of immediate-mode GUI frameworks, which
//! is that the entire UI (in Azuls case the DOM) is reconstructed and re-rendered
//! on every frame (instead of having functions that mutate the UI state like
//! `button.setText()`). This method of constructing UIs has a performance overhead
//! over methods that retain the UI, therefore Azul only calls the [`Layout::layout()`]
//! function when its absolutely necessary - inside of a callback, you can return
//! whether it is necessary to redraw the screen or not (by returning
//! [`Redraw`] or [`DontRedraw`], respectively).
//!
//! In difference to other immediate-mode frameworks, Azul does not immediately
//! draw to the screen, but rather "draws" to a [`Dom`]. This has several advantages,
//! such as making it possible to layout code at runtime, [loading a `Dom` from
//! an XML file], recognizing state changes by [diffing two frames], as well as being
//! able to reparent DOMs into almost any configuration to make components reusable
//! independent of the context they are in.
//!
//! # Hello world
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate azul;
//!
//! use azul::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct MyDataModel { }
//!
//! impl Layout for MyDataModel {
//!     fn layout(&self, _: LayoutInfo) -> Dom<Self> {
//!         Dom::label("Hello World")
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let app = App::new(MyDataModel { }, AppConfig::default()).unwrap();
//!     app.run(WindowCreateOptions::new(css::native()));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Running this code should return a window similar to this:
//!
//! ![Opening a blank window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maps4print/azul/master/doc/azul_tutorial_empty_window.png)
//!
//! # Development lifecycle
//!
//! A huge problem when working with GUI applications in Rust is managing the
//! compile time. Having to recompile your entire code when you just want to
//! shift an element a pixel to the right is not a good developer experience.
//! Azul has three main methods of combating compile time:
//!
//! - The [XML] system, which allows you to load DOMs at runtime [from a file]
//! - The [CSS] system, which allows you to [load and parse stylesheets]
//!
//! You can create your own hot-reload handler (for example to automatically
//! compile SASS / LESS or other files when reloading) by implementing the [`HotReloadHandler`]
//! trait or use the [default HotReloader]
//!
//! Due to Azuls stateless rendering architecture, hot-reloading also preserves
//! the current application state. Once you are done layouting your applications
//! UI, you can [transpile the XML code to valid Rust source code] using [azulc],
//! the Azul-XML-to-Rust compiler.
//!
//! Please note that the compiler isn't perfect - the XML system is very limited,
//! and parsing XML has a certain performance overhead, since it's done on every frame.
//! That is fine for debug builds, but the XML system should not be used in release mode.
//!
//! When you are done with designing the callbacks of your widget, you may want to
//! package the widget up to autmatically react to certain events without having the
//! user of your widget write any code to hook up the callbacks - for this purpose,
//!
//! # Application state management
//!
//! Azul features a [two way data binding] system using [`Ref<MyWidget>`] which you can
//! upcast to a [`RefAny`] (a type-erased `Rc<RefCell<Any>>`). This `RefAny` then [gets
//! stored in the `Dom`], and when invoking a [`DefaultCallback`] you can access the `RefAny`
//! through the [`DefaultCallbackInfo.state`] and [downcast it] to a `RefCell<MyWidget>`.
//!
//! Events bubble from inner to outer elements. You can either override the
//! default behaviour of widgets - for example, you can set the `ontextinput` callback
//! function to a custom callback function. This is one way of implementing "extends / override"
//! in Rust (which doesn't feature such concepts). You can also simply [prevent the default
//! callback from being called] or [prevent an event from bubbling to its parents].
//!
//! # Custom drawing and embedding external applications
//!
//! Azul is mostly concerned with rendering text, images and rectangular boxes (divs).
//! There is no audio / video playback support, but there are other crates for this purpose,
//! for example [rodio]. Azul is not a complete application development framework like Qt,
//! it only focuses on the GUI aspect.
//!
//! Other content can be drawn by drawing to an OpenGL texture (using a
//! [`GlCallback`]) and [hand it over to Azul]. This is how components like a
//! video player or other OpenGL-based visualizations can be injected into the UI,
//! without being part of the core library.
//!
//! You can draw to an OpenGL texture and  in order to display it
//! in the UI - the texture doesn't have to come from Azul itself, you can inject
//! it from an external application.
//!
//! Azul can also render to a headless target - for this purpose, the `text-layout`,
//! the `kayout` and the `core` components are separate crates, separate from the `azul`
//! crate, which depends on webrender and is meant as the desktop deployment target. By default,
//! `azul-layout` depends on a static build of HarfBuzz and FreeType for layouting glyphs,
//! but you can use the system-native builds by using `features = ["native-freetype"]`.
//!
//! The output of a headless rendering pass is a [`CachedDisplayList`], which contains all
//! information about how and where to render items - without actually rendering them anywhere.
//! This way you can render to a custom rendering target (such as a non-OpenGL renderer, a software renderer,
//! PDF / SVG or the web). However, you will have to handle input handling and hit-testing
//! yourself and provide a custom event loop.
//!
//! # File picker, popup dialogs, multi-window handling
//!
//! Azul implements the APIs to open native file picker dialogs, see the [dialogs] module.
//! You can create one or more windows in callbacks by calling [CallbackInfo::create_window()].
//! Each window carries a unique ID and a unique type, which can be user-defined. This type
//! gets then passed to the [`Layout::layout()`] function, and you can use said window type.
//!
//! For small, frameless popup windows, such as context menus and tearoff-windows, azul also
//! features `display: window-*;` (ex. `display: window-context-menu`) - which behaves exactly
//! like `display: absolute`, except that it displays the content of the div it is applied to in
//! a separate, frameless window.
//!
//! # Rendering of large / infinite data sets
//!
//! For rendering very large or infinite data sources such as long lists, tables, etc., Azul
//! provides [`IFrameCallbacks`] so that you don't have to render what you don't see on the screen.
//! For example, imagine you want to render a long list with multiple thousands of items. It isn't
//! necessary to show all items on screen at the same time, instead you only want to display a "window"
//! and load / unload items as the user scrolls.
//!
//! `IFrameCallbacks` do exactly that: The callbacks are stored in the `Dom` and during the layout step,
//! the callback is invoked with the size (of its container) and scroll offset. So, if you know that every
//! item is 20px high, and the `IFrameCallback` gets invoked with a height of 100px, then you only need
//! to render 5 divs into the Dom instead of thousands.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! There are a few limitations that should be noted:
//!
//! - There are no scrollbars yet.
//! - There is no support for CSS animations of any kind yet.
//! - There is no text selection yet.
//! - Changing dynamic variables will trigger an entire UI relayout and restyling
//!
